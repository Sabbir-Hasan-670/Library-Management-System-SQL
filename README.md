# Library-Management-System-SQL
A simple Library Management System built using MySQL. It tracks books, library users, and borrowing transactions. The system allows adding, updating, and querying books and users, as well as managing borrow/return operations. This project is designed to practice SQL skills such as table creation, relationships, and queries.
