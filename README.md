# Library Management System - SQL

## Description
This project is a **Library Management System** built using MySQL. It allows you to manage books, users, and transactions such as borrowing and returning books. The system tracks the available copies of books and generates reports for due books. The project is designed to help practice SQL and database management with an emphasis on normalization, relationships, and complex SQL queries.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Manage books in the library with details like title, author, genre, and available copies.
- **User Management**: Add and manage library members with personal information and membership type.
- **Transactions**: Track book borrowing and returning with due dates.
- **Reports**: Generate reports for overdue books and transaction history.

## Database Schema
The database consists of three main tables:
1. **Books**: Contains information about each book.
2. **Users**: Stores details of library members.
3. **Transactions**: Keeps records of book borrowings and returns.

## SQL Scripts
The project includes SQL scripts for:
- Creating tables (`Books`, `Users`, `Transactions`)
- Inserting sample data
- Various SQL queries for managing the library system
